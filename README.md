# 🧮 Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

This project focuses on performing **Customer Segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** on an eCommerce dataset. The objective is to identify distinct customer segments and provide actionable marketing insights based on purchasing behavior.  
This work is completed as part of **IE6400 – Foundations of Data Analytics Engineering (Fall 2025)**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer segmentation helps businesses understand their customers better and design targeted marketing strategies.  
In this project, RFM analysis is applied to transactional eCommerce data to group customers based on:
- **Recency** – How recently a customer made a purchase
- **Frequency** – How often a customer makes purchases
- **Monetary** – How much money a customer spends

Clustering techniques are then used to form meaningful customer segments.
